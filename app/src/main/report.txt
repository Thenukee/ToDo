Technical Report: Todo App Android Project
Project Overview
This is a comprehensive Todo application for Android built with modern architectural patterns and libraries. The application allows users to create and manage tasks, organize them into lists, set due dates and reminders, attach files, and back up data to Firebase.

Architecture
The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with a clean separation of concerns:

View Layer: Jetpack Compose UI components
ViewModel Layer: Manages UI state and business logic
Repository Layer: Abstracts data sources
Data Layer: Room database, DataStore preferences, and Firebase cloud storage
Libraries and Technologies
Core Android & Kotlin
Kotlin: Primary programming language (1.9.x)
Jetpack Compose: Modern declarative UI toolkit (1.6.3)
Material3: Design system implementation
Coroutines: Asynchronous programming (1.9.0)
Kotlin Flow: Reactive data streams
Architecture Components
ViewModel: UI state management (2.8.1)
Room: SQLite database abstraction (2.6.1)
DataStore: Preferences storage (1.1.1)
Navigation Compose: In-app navigation (2.7.7)
Hilt: Dependency injection (2.50)
WorkManager: Background task scheduling (2.9.0)
Firebase
Firebase Auth: User authentication
Firebase Firestore: Cloud database for backup
Firebase Storage: File storage capabilities
Utility Libraries
Timber: Logging utility (5.0.1)
Reorderable: Drag-and-drop functionality for lists (0.9.6)
DocumentFile: File system interactions (1.0.1)
Database Structure
Room Database (TodoDatabase)
The app uses a Room database with the following entities:

TaskEntity
Primary task model with fields:
id (String, UUID): Primary key
title (String): Task title
description (String): Task details
isCompleted (Boolean): Completion status
isImportant (Boolean): Priority flag
isInMyDay (Boolean): My Day collection flag
dueDate (Long?): Optional due date timestamp
reminderTime (Long?): Optional reminder timestamp
listId (String?): Foreign key to TaskListEntity
position (Int): For ordering tasks
createdAt/modifiedAt (Long): Timestamps
TaskListEntity
Represents task lists:
id (String): Primary key
name (String): List name
color (Int): List color
emoji (String?): Optional emoji
position (Int): For ordering lists
createdAt (Long): Creation timestamp
SubTaskEntity
Represents steps within a task:
id (String): Primary key
taskId (String): Foreign key to TaskEntity
title (String): Subtask title
isCompleted (Boolean): Completion status
position (Int): For ordering subtasks
AttachmentEntity
Represents file attachments:
id (String): Primary key
taskId (String): Foreign key to TaskEntity
uri (String): File URI
name (String): File name
type (String): MIME type
size (Long): File size in bytes
Data Flow
Repository Pattern
The TaskRepository acts as a mediator between the ViewModel and data sources:

UI State Management
ViewModels expose Flow<T> objects that the UI collects
Changes to data trigger UI updates through Flow collection
ViewModels launch coroutines for background operations
Database Access
Data access is performed through DAOs (Data Access Objects)
TaskDao provides methods for CRUD operations
Queries return Flow objects for reactive UI updates
Key Features Implementation
Task Management
Tasks can be created, edited, organized into lists
Tasks support subtasks, attachments, due dates, and reminders
Special collections: My Day, Important, Planned
List Management
Users can create custom lists with colors and emoji icons
Lists can be reordered via drag-and-drop (using Reorderable library)
Lists can be duplicated (with all contained tasks)
Cloud Backup
BackupWorker extends CoroutineWorker to handle background backup
Automatic scheduled backups via WorkManager
Anonymous authentication via Firebase Auth
Task data synced to Firebase Firestore
File Structure
Key Implementation Details
Task Reordering
The app implements custom position tracking for tasks and lists, with specialized swap functions in the DAO:

Cloud Backup System
The backup system is implemented using WorkManager with network constraints:

BackupWorker handles data extraction and upload
Anonymous Firebase authentication ensures user data separation
Backup status is shown through system notifications
User preferences can enable/disable automatic backups
User Preferences
Preferences are stored using Jetpack DataStore:

Technical Challenges & Solutions
Task Reordering: Implemented position-based ordering with atomic swap operations
Data Relationships: Used Room's @Relation annotation to handle one-to-many relationships
Background Sync: Leveraged WorkManager with network constraints for efficient backups
State Management: Used Kotlin Flow to maintain reactive UI updates
This Todo application demonstrates a well-structured, modern Android application following best practices for architecture, data management, and UI implementation.
